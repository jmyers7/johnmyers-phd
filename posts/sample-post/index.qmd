This is a sample post. Evidently this sentence will be previewed!

## Here's a heading

Here's a sentence after the heading.

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)
source("/Users/johnmyers/Documents/work/johnmyers-phd/aux-files/custom-theme.R")

```

Did that display? It did! Here is a displayed math equation:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
$$

What does it look like when I type LaTeX inline? Ok, the above equation expresses the solutions to the polynomial equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. How does this look though?

## Running some code!

Let's try running some code.

The code is here:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show R code"

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point(color = theme_colors["yellow"]) +
    custom_theme() +
    labs(title = "highway MPG vs. displacement", x = "displacement", y = "highway MPG")
```
