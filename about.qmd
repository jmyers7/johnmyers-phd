I'm a Ph.D. mathematician and university professor with a background that spans both theoretical and applied mathematics. My undergraduate education was in applied and computational mathematics with a minor in physics, where I took courses ranging from dynamical systems theory, to software engineering in C++, to quantum mechanics and relativity theory. In graduate school and the first few years of my career as a research mathematician, I specialized in [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra){target="_blank"} and [commutative ring theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra){target="_blank"}, focusing on the bridge between [modern algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra){target="_blank"} and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry){target="_blank"} and [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology){target="_blank"}. However, my interests have gradually shifted toward more practical domains, where I now work with machine learning, AI, statistics, and probability, with particular interest in industry applications.  You can find my early mathematical research on my [arXiv page](https://arxiv.org/a/myers_j_2.html){target="_blank"}.

In addition to my role as a mathematician, I am also an educator who has taught 13 distinct college mathematics courses ranging from introductory calculus, to applied engineering mathematics, to upper-division theoretical courses, and have been recognized with teaching awards for my classroom work. Notable among these was a novel course in my dissertation research areas of commutative ring theory and algebraic geometry—topics not often taught at the undergraduate level—and a year-long course in probabilistic machine learning for which I wrote the textbook and developed the supporting infrastructure, all available in the navigation bar at the top.

I'm fascinated by how mathematical abstraction leads to practical power. The same logical structures that seem purely theoretical often turn out to be exactly what we need to solve real-world problems. This interplay between abstract thinking and concrete applications is what makes mathematics endlessly exciting to me.
